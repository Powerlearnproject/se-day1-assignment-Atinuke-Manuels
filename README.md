#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.
Software engineering is the process of designing, creating, testing, and maintaining software. It's important in the technology industry because it ensures that software is built efficiently, works well, and can be updated or fixed when needed.


Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.
1. The creation of programming languages: Early languages like Fortran and COBOL made it easier to write and understand code.
2. The development of the Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC): This provided a structured way to plan, create, and maintain software.
3. The rise of Agile methodologies: Agile introduced flexible, iterative approaches to software development, allowing teams to adapt quickly to changes.


List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.
1. Planning: Define the project’s goals and determine what resources are needed.
2. Analysis: Gather and analyze the requirements for the software.
3. Design: Create the architecture and design the software’s components.
4. Implementation: Write the code for the software.
5. Testing: Ensure the software works correctly by finding and fixing bugs.
6. Deployment: Release the software to users.
7. Maintenance: Update and fix the software as needed after it is released.


Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.
    Waterfall is a linear approach where each phase is completed before moving on to the next. It's good for projects with well-defined requirements, like building a bridge.
    while
    Agile is flexible, with work done in small, iterative cycles. It’s better for projects where requirements may change, like developing a new mobile app.

Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.
- Software Developer: Writes and maintains the code, ensuring the software functions as intended.
- Quality Assurance Engineer: Tests the software to find and fix bugs before the software is released.
- Project Manager: Oversees the project, coordinates the team, manages deadlines, and ensures the project meets its goals.


Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.
- IDEs: Tools like Visual Studio Code and IntelliJ IDEA help developers write and test code more efficiently by providing features like code completion and debugging.
VCS / Version Control Systems: Systems like Git help teams keep track of changes to code, collaborate more effectively, and revert to earlier versions if needed.

What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.
- Dealing with complex code: Break the code into smaller, manageable parts.
- Debugging issues: Use debugging tools and write clear, maintainable code.
- Staying updated with technology: Regularly learn new skills and stay informed about industry trends.

Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.
- Unit Testing: Tests individual components to ensure they work correctly.
- Integration Testing: Checks if different components work well together.
- System Testing: Verifies that the complete system meets the requirements.
- Acceptance Testing: Confirms that the software is ready for delivery to the user.

#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.
Prompt engineering is the process of crafting clear and specific instructions (prompts) to get accurate and useful responses from AI models. It’s important because the quality of the prompt directly affects the quality of the AI’s output.

Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.
- Vague Prompt: "Tell me about animals."
- Improved Prompt: "Give me a list of five interesting facts about elephants."
Explanation: The improved prompt is more effective because it clearly specifies what you want to know (facts), how many (five), and about which animal (elephants). This reduces ambiguity and helps the AI give a more accurate response.
